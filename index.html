        <h2>Mission Statement</h2><br>
        <p>Every year Save the Animals (STA) comes to the aid of many injured, displaced and orphaned wild animals in need of help. With the training, skill and devotion of licensed volunteer rehabilitators, hundreds of animals can be successfully rescued, rehabilitated and released back into the wild.</p><br>
        <p>STA recognizes the importance of education in the preservation and conservation of wildlife. Before we can begin to make significant differences, people need to understand the importance of animals to our environment. We work toward increasing awareness of how the actions of people affect wildlife and what can be done to protect these animals. STA reaches out to educate the general public on these topics through its quarterly newsletter and display booths at community fairs and events.</p><br>
        <p>Every year STA responds to thousands of wildlife questions from the public. Anyone who has a problem or question about wildlife can call us for information. An injured bird, a raccoon that has taken up residence in your chimney or a baby squirrel that might be orphaned are all questions that we can advise and assist you with.</p><br>
        <p>Please check out the rest of our web site for more information on endangered species and how you can help us to prevent more from going extinct.</p>
